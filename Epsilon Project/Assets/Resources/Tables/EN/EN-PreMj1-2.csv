I know it from reliable sources, you don't need to know more.;Coming from someone who starts conversations with threats...;Someone who will put their threats to execution if you keep talking back.;;;;;
;Ok...;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
Of course, taking him down wouldn't be that hard if there was only that;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
The problem is that he's basically untouchable.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
His company keeps covering him, even though he has already made dozens of victims.;Do you have an example of something he did?;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
Lately, he has forced an employee to grant him certain... Favors;For a promotion?;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
For not getting her professional career ruined by him.;Talk about a trade...;As you say, yes.;;;;;
;Damn, that's disgusting!;We are on the same page.;;;;;
;;;;;;;
As I've told you, I'm going to ''ruin his life''.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
By that, I mean I'm going to blackmail him and force him to resign from his job.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
Force him to do other things after that, but that's none of your business.;Okay.;;;;;;
;I'll help you, but that's none of my business?;I might tell you more later, if you really want to know.;;;;;
;;;;;;;
Alright, I will send you a link.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
It leads to the social network page of our ''victim'';I'm not sure to get where you're going with that;;;;;;
;Did you hack his mailbox?;No, he graciously sent me his login details by letter...;;;;;
;;;;;;;
Firstly, you are going to search his mailbox;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
And secondly, you will find THE compromising mail;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
The very one he doesn't want anyone to see.;And how would I know if it's the good mail?;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
By relying on his social network page. This is where he posts all the things he doesn't need to hide, which helps us learn about what wouldn't work against him.;Ok, I think I got it;;;;<BRANCH>PreMJ1-3;;
;I'm not sure I understand;;;;<BRANCH>PreMJ1-2b;;
