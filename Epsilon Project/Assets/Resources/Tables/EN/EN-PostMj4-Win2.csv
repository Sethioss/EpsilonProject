In any case, their motivation is the same as mine.;;;;;;;

We all believe that our society will crumble, and in a much earlier than we think.;What kind of earlier?;;;;;;

When talking about the end of society as we know it, predictions always estimate sometime around the first half of the 21st century.;That's pretty near...;;;;;;
;Oh, that's fine then !;;;;;;
;;;;;;;

;I already know about this.;;;;<BRANCH>PostMj4-Win2b;;

The most convincing example would be the case of global warming.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
This is simple : The Earth warms up, result? Ice caps are melting.;And?;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
The ice and snow on Earth have a very important role : reflect the sunlight.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
The more sunlight gets reflected, the warmer the Earth gets.;I think I understand.;;;;;;
;...And?;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
If the snow melts, the Earth gets warmer. As a result, the snow melts even more and the Earth gets even warmer.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
Positive feedback, that's the pompous name people refer to when they talk about vicious circles.;I see. And you want to stop this ''positive feedback''?;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
We want to accelerate them.;What?!;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
I will give you more details later. I will need you again soon.;Wait!;;;;<BRANCH>PreMj5-1a;;
