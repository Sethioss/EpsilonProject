I'd like to give you the important details, but I can't for now.;There are a lot of things you don't want to tell me about...;;;;;;
;Okay, I see;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
It is for your safety that I'm not telling you a lot.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
Still, I'm sorry about it.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
Anyway. The infiltration isn't for now. There are all the preparation steps before.;What kind of preparation?;;;;;;
;And you need me for these?;Exactly.;;;;;
;;;;;;;
Most of the preparation has already been done, but there's still another important task left.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
You will help me localise the perfect place to localize the perfect spot to place the device at.;You think I have what it takes?;;;;;;
;How am I going to do that?;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
Don't worry, I've done most of the work already. The rest is very simple, even for someone like you.;Explain to me, then.;;;;;;
;Someone like me...?;Haha;;;;;
;;;;;;;
So, basically:;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
I will send you a link to a 3D map that you will be able to rotate as you wish.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
On the 3D map, you will see a large quantity of ''cables''. One of these cables will be marked with a blue pointer.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
You'll need to locate this cable, and follow it to the corresponding symbol.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
You'll have to select the correct cable, but be careful. There are many of them, and you might mess up if you don't rotate the map enough.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
You will then select the cable that you think is the right one. Is that clear for you?;Yes, I got it!;;;;;<LINK>FindThePath 'Perfect then. Good luck.';
;No, not really, no.;Well read my messages again. Maybe seeing the map will also help you understand...;;;;;
