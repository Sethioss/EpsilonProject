Okay. I will tell you something new.;;;00:02:00:00;;;;
;;;;;;;
I am part of a group that has a very important goal. And I'm contacting you so you can help me and my group.;What's your goal?;I can't tell you about it for now, but I'll tell you soon.;;;;;
;What kind of group are you?;We are an activist hacker group, that's all I can tell you for now.;;;;;
;;;;;;;
Just know that we have a goal. And we can't accomplish it alone.;And who exactly do you need?;;;;;;
;Is that the reason why you're contacting me?;I'm not talking about you.;;;;;
;;;;;;;
We need another hacker group, one that acts in domains that are unknown to us.;Where are they?;;;;;;
;What do they do?;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
Unfortunately, it is impossible to know what they precisely do and where they actually are, even for us.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
We just know that they can help us.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
We already required their help in the past.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
It personally was a bad experience for me, but we have no choice.;And what do you want me to do?;I'm getting to it.;;;;;
;Are they THAT important?;I honestly can't answer. I just know that I need to contact them.;;;;;
;;;;;;;
As I was saying, we've already worked with them in the past. Before cutting all communications, they left us a crypted link which, according to them, would allow us to recontact them in the future.;And what's the issue?;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
The issue is that we don't know enough about them to know if we can trust them. We're not clicking on this link until we're sure it's safe.;And what's your point?;;;;;;
;So you're gonna make me your guinea pig, right?!;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
You'll click on this link and contact the hacker yourself;You're insane!;;;;;;
;You're crazy!;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
Rest assured.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
The group we're talking about doesn't care about someone like you.;Is this lie true?;I promess. If anything were to happen to you, I'd protect you anyway.;;;;;
;I thought you didn't know anything about them?;We don't know a lot, that's different. We know they also have important objectives, and that they wouldn't bother with someone like you.;;;;;
;;;;;;;
I'll send you the link. You'll click and you'll contact the hacker. Come back to me when you're finished.;Okay...;;;;;<LINK>DeepWeb 'Here it is';
