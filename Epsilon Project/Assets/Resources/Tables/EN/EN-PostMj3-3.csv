I'm currently programming what will allow you to disable the building's cameras.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
I initially thought about disabling all the cameras at once, but that would be too suspicious.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
Instead, you'll have do disable the cameras one by one as I pass under them.;Why don't your partners take care of it?;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
I just have serious doubts about my teammates and their intentions.;You don't trust them?;;;;;;
;You think they'd betray you?;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
I'm wondering if they don't intend on sacrificing me...;What makes you think that?;;;;<BRANCH>PostMj3-3a;;
;You should run away, then!;;;;<BRANCH>PostMj3-3b;;
