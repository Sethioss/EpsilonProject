Now, onto your final task.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
The hacking device was successfully planted, and we managed to connect to it.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
We will be able to spread a virus we've recently finished coding.;Interesting.;;;;;;
;That quickly?;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
The virus wasn't difficult to code, the harder part will be to make sure it spreads correctly.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
That actually is the purpose of our hacking device. It will help us get access to the servers and disable/re-enable them as we wish.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
I'm the one tasked with this mission, but 2 of us won't be too much. You will take care of part of the servers.;Je vais devoir les désactiver ou les réactiver?;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
You will need to re-enable them. The company will probably react to the virus spreading by disabling all of their servers.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
Our role will be to make sure the virus spread. Even if the servers get disabled, the virus just have to be in it for only a few seconds.;I didn't get it, should I disable or enable them?;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
Re-enable them. To put it simply, it's like disabling defences. It won't be very difficult, but I just need you to help me for a part of the servers that I won't be able to handle myself.;I'm not sure I got it.;;;;;;
;I got it.;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
Don't worry, I'll give you more details when I get back to you.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
Alright, let me get onto your last task.;;;00:04:00:00;;;;
;;;;;;;
Before you, you'll have multiple ''boxes'', which will represent different servers.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
As soon as you'll click my link, the virus will start spreading.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
They will try to stop its progression, I've represented their defense with shields to make it simple for you.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
As soon as a server is contaminated, you'll have to write a command. Of course, I made them appear at the right time.;That's a lot of info!;;;;;;
;Ok, I got it.;;;;<BRANCH>PreMj5-3;;
;;;;;;;
Basically, you click on the shield logos, and you write the commands that are prompted to you.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
I've simplified my explanations, you should succeed easily.;;;;;;<BRANCH>PreMj5-3;
