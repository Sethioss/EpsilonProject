Our base goal was to make the data we stole from the company indecipherable.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
And given how important these were, it would have had a devastating effect on many of the central aspects of our society.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
That would have easily created a domino effect.;But...?;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
But dissension began to emerge within the group.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
When some people understood that the actual goal was to ask a ransom to the company.;A ransom?;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
Yes. An enormous amount of money, against the key that would have allowed them to get their data back.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
Of course, it didn't work out, as many didn't agree with this goal. Until someone eventually ratted us out.;;;;;;<CHECK>wentBackHome = 1 ? <BRANCH>Final-2a :  !;

I had already been pushed off, so I don't know a lot about this situation. The only thing I know is that someone from the group had actually attempted to protect me.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
They are the ones who got rid of the body.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
Anyway;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
I'm sorry for everything;;;;;;<END>;
